So you consider yourself useless and worth nothing OR you have nothing unique that differs you from others. You might want to re-evaluate your interests.

I have been a programmer since I was first taught programming language in grade 7th. Back then we were taught [GW Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). I have been programming since then. I chose this field because I love to experiment and tinker with the code. I would rather stay home write some awesome code instead of going out and partying.

On the other hand, I have also been a student for all this time but I was always categorized as an average student (something my brother excels at, causing problem for me on the result day at home). It never got much of my attention as it was all boring and useless to me.

So this has taught me one crucial lesson, a lesson that helps me take my life decisions, that **always pursue what you love.** You may have heard it before but actually implement it in your life. Think of something so awesome to you, that you would skip a date with a hot girl for it.

I will now go back to my coding cave by leaving you with this quote.

In a famous letter by Albert Einstein to his son, he advises his son:

> “That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes” _— Albert Einstein_
