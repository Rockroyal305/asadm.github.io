[StartupList.pk](https://www.startuplist.pk) now has a good amount of funded startups. So here is a little birds-eye view of how we are doing in terms of getting funded. These numbers (and more) are individually detailed with references on the [homepage](https://www.startuplist.pk).

### Disclaimers

*   **Most deals are not public**, I personally know at least a dozen that aren’t disclosed to public. So this is just the tip of the iceberg.
*   I tried my best to remove all “non-Pakistani” startups such as Careem, Daraz. It’s still hard to draw a line. **The above list is almost strictly Pakistani**.
*   **It’s easy to deceive PR about funding** and frankly local founders tend to do that a lot. I still tried to do my best but I cannot be 100% certain until I see the actual term sheets.
*   Lastly, getting funded is not an indicator of company’s success. Sadly, other metrics are even more harder to get.
