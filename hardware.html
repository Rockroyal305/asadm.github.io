		<h4>Armband Concept for Controlling Home Electronics</h4>
		<p>Me (with <a href="http://mujtabachang.com" target="_blank">Mujtaba</a>) developed an armband proof-of-concept to control home electronics just by pointing at electronics (like a speaker, tv, lights etc) and doing a gesture to control them. The hardware consisted of IMU sensor, smart switchboard. <a href="https://vimeo.com/95529039">Here's an early video.</a></p>

		<h4><a href="http://memories.nokia.com/en/images/41886667-e43a-4cc4-8abe-97f6d33038c9">MMG (Muscle Noise) Recognition</a></h4>
		<p>Me (with <a href="http://mujtabachang.com" target="_blank">Mujtaba</a>) developed a very cheap armband to detect MMG signals, which we then sent to a neural network and captured/recognized few gestures. The hardware consisted of pre-amplified microphones.</p>

		<h4><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/therobotronics/ledpong">LED Pong</a></h4>
		<p>A course project. We used logic gates to design classic pong. The quick hack also allowed us to add bot player.</p>
